# PackHacks2021

Created by North Carolina State University students, Ben Kimbrough and Ryan Rice, this project tackles the data analytics challenge of college financial datasets. We will cover the trends in federal debt due to the FAFSA from 2013 to 2020 in the first half of our website. We will cover linear regression and a hypothesis about our data. In the second half of the website, we will present the amount of money that each state is given for financial aid from FAFSA.
